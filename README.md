# Satisfied-Airline-Passengers
First, I import the libraries I need and then, I started to read the data file.
I must show the satisfaction level for the passengers in the trip. 
In data cleaning step:
 - I noticed that there is categorical data in some columns, and i had 'object' type, so i converted them into 'category' type.
 - I notcied that there is no duplicated values.
 - There is a one column that has "NaN" values, it's "Arrival Delay in Minutes", but I droped it because I found correspndence between it and "Departure Delay in Minutes".
 - Then I started to visualize the categorical data.
 - After that, I visualized the numerical data.
